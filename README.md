Key Components:
API Call: Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap.
Tkinter GUI: Allows the user to input a city name and displays weather details like temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed.
Optional Plot: Includes a function to visualize temperature trends using matplotlib, which can be extended to show forecast data if needed.

How to Run:
Replace "your_openweather_api_key" with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Run the Python script. A window will appear where you can enter the city name to fetch and display weather data.
(Optional) Modify the visualize_weather() function to fetch forecast data or show temperature trends based on the current city.

Simply sign up for OpenWeatherApi and get your api and replace it in the code!
